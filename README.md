•	Response surface modeling is an empirical modeling that uses a system of sample responses obtained from experiments to predict the response of the system with statistical and optimization techniques. Effects of operating parameters and the interactions of independent variables on the response can be assessed in an economical way. 
•	This study is done to analyze the flare tests for which soot/DE/CE data are available and develop response surface models to predict flare performance and determine desirable range of air and steam assist.
